HTTP request:
	request line : methode, URI, protocol version
	header fields: 	- request modifiers
					- client information
					- representation metadata 
	empty line : indicate the end of the header section
	message body : payload body (if any)

HTTP response:
	status line : protocol version (success or error code), textual reason phrase
	header fields : (optional)  - server information
								- resource metadata
								- representation metadata
	empty line
	message body: payload body if any


The normal procedure for parsing an HTTP message is to read the 
start-line into a structure, read each header field into a hash table 
by field name until the empty line, and then use the parsed data to 
determine if a message body is expected.  If a message body has been
indicated, then it is read as a stream until an amount of octets
equal to the message body length is read or the connection is closed.

a recipient must parse an HTTP message as a sequence of octets in an encoding 
that is a superset of US-ASCII .
