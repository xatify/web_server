- Concepts:

	
	* Connections handler:
		objectif: managing the connections
			- establishing new connection
			- detecting connection failure
			- closing connection
			- listen for (read/write) on the connection
			- close connection
		
		* Connection:
			- each connection is defined by a fd


		* Connection: two types of connections:
			- listening connection:
				* accept new client and create new data connection for it
				* logs the new connection
			- data connection:
				* handle messaging between client and server
				* a channel for (request / response)
				* support pipelining
				* capability of persistence
				+ has two buffers: input and output
					* read	request into input buffer
					* write response to output buffer


	* Executer:
		+	request
		+	response
		
		- using logger (for partial log)
		- construct request
			//	if (request.parse () is not ok)
			//		generate an appropriate error response.
			//	execute response
		- generate response

		- execute: has states
			* parsing:
				try parsing request
				if there is an error 
					set state to error state:
				if (SL and HF are parsed)
					set state to execute.
			* error:
				generate appropriate error response;
				set state to sending state; 
			* execute state
				* depending on the request
				* if payload is expected and request is not complete yet 
					request.recvpayload ()
				* apply URL mapping:
					- redirection
						generate redirection request;
					- static file
						generate static file request
					- cgi
						generate cgi request
				* 
			* sending
				send the response throw the connection




	* Message
		+ start line
		+ header fields
		+ payload
			; a buffer or a fd for storing ?	
		* reusing capability
			- reset message to blank
	* Requist: Message
		* abilities for Parsing
			- request line (start line)
			- header fields
			- payload

	* Response

	* Configuration
		- must be accessed from everywhere in the program
		- two kind of configuration
			* default confs
			* user confs:
				- some user confs can override some default confs.
			- 
	* Logger:
		function:
			- logging of partial (request | response)
			- logging of new connection.
		where:
			- the logs files set in the confguration
			- standard output / error
	* CGI
